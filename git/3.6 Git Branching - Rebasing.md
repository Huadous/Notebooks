# [3.6 Git Branching - Rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)

### More Interesting Rebases

You can also have your rebase replay on something other than the rebase target branch. Take a history like [A history with a topic branch off another topic branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/ch00/rbdiag_e), for example. You branched a topic branch (`server`) to add some server-side functionality to your project, and made a commit. Then, you branched off that to make the client-side changes (`client`) and committed a few times. Finally, you went back to your server branch and did a few more commits.

Suppose you decide that you want to merge your client-side changes into your mainline for a release, but you want to hold off on the server-side changes until it’s tested further. You can take the changes on `client` that aren’t on `server` (`C8` and `C9`) and replay them on your `master` branch by using the `--onto` option of `git rebase`:

```console
$ git rebase --onto master server client
```

This basically says, “Take the `client` branch, figure out the patches since it diverged from the `server` branch, and replay these patches in the `client` branch as if it was based directly off the `master` branch instead.” It’s a bit complex, but the result is pretty cool.

Now you can fast-forward your `master` branch (see [Fast-forwarding your `master` branch to include the client branch changes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/ch00/rbdiag_g)):

```console
$ git checkout master
$ git merge client
```

Let’s say you decide to pull in your server branch as well. You can rebase the `server` branch onto the `master` branch without having to check it out first by running `git rebase <basebranch> <topicbranch>` — which checks out the topic branch (in this case, `server`) for you and replays it onto the base branch (`master`):

```console
$ git rebase master server
```

This replays your `server` work on top of your `master` work, as shown in [Rebasing your server branch on top of your `master` branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/ch00/rbdiag_h).

Then, you can fast-forward the base branch (`master`):

```console
$ git checkout master
$ git merge server
```

You can remove the `client` and `server` branches because all the work is integrated and you don’t need them anymore, leaving your history for this entire process looking like [Final commit history](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/ch00/rbdiag_i):

```console
$ git branch -d client
$ git branch -d server
```
